# Project Mongo API

Week 13 at Technigo. First week using Mongo and Mongoose. This project was to create an API with one endpoint that return a single result and one endpoint that return a collection of results.

## The problem

This week my biggest challange was to figure out all the installations and how to use Mongodb, Atlas and Compass.

Technologies I used
-MongoDB
-Model data in Mongo using Mongoose
-Store secret password

If I had more time I would do more code and try different ways to return endpoints.
